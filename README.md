# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) built from scratch using only NumPy and Python. The project demonstrates fundamental sequence modeling techniques and explores backpropagation through time (BPTT).

## Features
- Implementation of a basic RNN without using deep learning frameworks.
- Training the RNN on sequential data.
- Optimization using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).
- Analysis of model performance and training behavior.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the project:
```bash
python rnn_from_scratch.py
```



## Results
- Demonstrated the ability of RNNs to model sequential dependencies.
- Implemented BPTT for optimizing the RNN weights.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and improve the implementation.
